Chaotic Rage is a silly little shooter game. A simple graphical style allows for a focus on gameplay. The game is very customisable with full modding support. There are a variety of game types, with scripting done in Lua. Multiple view modes - top down, behind player and first-person - allow for a unique perspective of the action. Dynamic and scriptable weather and day/night effects create a dynamic environment. The gameplay is rounded out by a number of interesting vehicles including tanks, utes, and trains. Last but not least is a wide range of weapons including shotguns, machine guns and flame throwers.

Compiling
---------

Chaotic Rage is supported on a number of platforms and through various
build environments. For compilation instructions for various platforms,
see the file COMPILE.md


Making mods
-----------

The game is designed with extensability in mind. All of game data
is abstracted into data modules, and multiple mods can be loaded at once.

The mods contain the definitions for everything in the game,
as well as 3D models, sounds, songs, etc. The game also uses the scripting
language Lua, which provides logic for AIs, as well as managed game types.
