Some characters and animations are sourced from Mixamo by Adobe.

  You can use both characters and animations royalty free for
  personal, commercial, and non-profit projects including:

   - Incorporating characters into illustrations and graphic art
   - 3D printing characters
   - Creating films
   - Creating video games

Beyond this, I've attempted to find additional licence information
without any success. I certainly cannot find a formal licence
document on the Adobe or Mixamo website.
