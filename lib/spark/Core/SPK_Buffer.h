	* @brief An abstract class that defines the interface for the additional buffers of Group
	*
	* A buffer allows a Group to hold additional data.<br>
	* Typically, they are used for rendering as the GPU or the rendering engine needs data to be organized in a specific way.<br>
	* <br>
	* Their use can be extended to anything to store data within a group.<br>
	* Buffers can also be swapped as particles are swap within a group. This allows to have the ordering of data consistent with the ordering of particles.<br>
	* However, if the buffers are only used for temporary storage on a single frame (most of the renderers), it is not necessary to swap the data.<br>
	* <br>
	* A buffer also contains a flag which is an unsigned integer that can be used to check the validity of the buffer from frame to frame.<br>
	* <br>
	* Note that only a group can create and delete a buffer. The user can ask a group to create a new buffer by passing a BufferCreator object to it.<br>
	* Check out the group interface about buffers for more info.
