How to build a Debian package (deb) using the git repo as source and uploading
it to the Chaotic Rage PPA

TODO: Upload only the source diff to ppa
TODO: Use 'make deb' to reduce the manual steps

Install necessary packages
	> sudo apt-get install build-essential devscripts ubuntu-dev-tools \
	debhelper dh-make patch cdbs quilt gnupg fakeroot lintian pbuilder piuparts


Set up gpg-key and ssh-key to be able to sign the package
	Create a launchpad account
	https://launchpad.net

	Setup your gpg-key & ssh-key
	https://help.launchpad.net/YourAccount/ImportingYourPGPKey
	https://help.launchpad.net/YourAccount/CreatingAnSSHKeyPair

	Set DEBEMAIL and DEBFULLNAME (optional - add these to '~/.bashrc')
	(must be the same as the gpg key (command: 'gpg --list-keys'))
		> export DEBEMAIL=<email address>
		> export DEBFULLNAME="Full Name"


Create the source from repo
	Clone the git repo
	> git clone git@github.com:TheJosh/chaotic-rage.git
	Go to the Chaotic Rage source root folder
	> cd chaotic-rage
	Remove any previous tar files and PPA updates if any
	> rm -f chaoticrage*.tar.* && rm -rf ../deb_build/
	Create the file 'chaoticrage_<version>.orig.tar.xz'
	> make dist
	Use the created file as source
	> mkdir ../deb_build && \
	cp chaoticrage_* ../deb_build && \
	cd ../deb_build && \
	tar xpvf chaoticrage_* && \
	cd chaoticrage-*


Prepare for building the package
	Update changelog
		Increase the Debian release number (edit with 'dch --edit')
		> dch --increment
		Note: Update the target (Ubuntu version) to e.g. 'trusty'.


Build package
	> debuild
	The Debian package is now ready to be installed


Build for Personal Package Archive (PPA)
	Brand new package with no existing version in Ubuntu's repositories
	(will be uploaded with the .orig.tar.gz file)
	> debuild -S -sa


Test building locally
	pbuilder allows you to build packages locally on your machine. The build
	will be done in a minimal and clean environment. And possible to set up
	multiple instances for various Ubuntu and Debian releases.

	Set up pbuilder (only needed once per release)
	> pbuilder-dist <release> create
	Build a test package
	> pbuilder-dist <release> build ../<package>_<version>.dsc


Upload to the Chaotic Rage PPA
	> dput ppa:chaotic-rage/chaoticrage ../<source.changes>
	
	Update the repo with the new changelog and any other changes
	cp -r debian/ ../../chaotic-rage/tools/debian_package/
	cp chaoticrage.desktop ../../chaotic-rage/tools/debian_package/
