License: CC-BY-3.0
 THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE 
 COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY 
 COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS 
 AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
 .
 BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE 
 BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE 
 CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE 
 IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
 .
 1. Definitions
 .
    "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other 
 pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, 
 arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or 
 phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other 
 form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any 
 form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that 
 constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose 
 of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, 
 performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation 
 with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an Adaptation for the 
 purpose of this License.
    "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as 
 encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or 
 other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below, 
 which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute 
 intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in 
 unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting 
 separate and independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into 
 a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered 
 an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this License.
    "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and copies 
 of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of 
 ownership.
    "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that 
 offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.
    "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the 
 individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no 
 individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in 
 the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other 
 persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise 
 perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case 
 of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first fixes 
 the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of 
 broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.
    "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of 
 this License including without limitation any production in the literary, 
 scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its 
 expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; 
 a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a dramatic or 
 dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a 
 musical composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are 
 assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work of 
 drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a 
 photographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process 
 analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, 
 sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography, 
 architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation 
 of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work 
 performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise 
 considered a literary or artistic work.
    "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License 
 who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the 
 Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise 
 rights under this License despite a previous violation.
    "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to 
 communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or process, 
 including by wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make 
 available to the public Works in such a way that members of the public may 
 access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them; to 
 perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the communication to 
 the public of the performances of the Work, including by public digital 
 performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including 
 signs, sounds or images.
    "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including without 
 limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and 
 reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected performance 
 or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.
 .
 2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, 
 or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or 
 exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection 
 under copyright law or other applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor 
 hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the 
 duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the 
 Work as stated below:
 .
    to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more 
 Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;
    to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, 
 including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly 
 label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original 
 Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original work was 
 translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The 
 original work has been modified.";
    to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in 
 Collections; and,
    to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
 .
    For the avoidance of doubt:
        Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in 
 which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory 
 licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to 
 collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this 
 License;
        Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which 
 the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing 
 scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such 
 royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and,
        Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect 
 royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member 
 of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that 
 society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or 
 hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such 
 modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other 
 media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by 
 Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made 
 subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
    You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of 
 this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier 
 (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly 
 Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the 
 terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise 
 the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may 
 not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this 
 License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You 
 Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the 
 Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that 
 restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights 
 granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) 
 applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require 
 the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of 
 this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You 
 must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as 
 required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon 
 notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the 
 Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.
    If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or 
 Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), 
 keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the 
 medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or 
 pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or 
 Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, 
 publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in 
 Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the 
 name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to 
 the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to 
 be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright 
 notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with 
 Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the 
 Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original 
 Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit 
 required by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; 
 provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum 
 such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the 
 Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner 
 at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For 
 the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section 
 for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising 
 Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or 
 imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, 
 Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the 
 Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original 
 Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
    Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be 
 otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly 
 Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, 
 You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in 
 relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor 
 or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in 
 which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the 
 right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, 
 modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's 
 honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, 
 this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, 
 to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this 
 License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS 
 THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND 
 CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, 
 WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A 
 PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, 
 ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. 
 SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH 
 EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN 
 NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, 
 INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS 
 LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE 
 POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
    This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically 
 upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities 
 who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, 
 however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or 
 entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 
 and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
    Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is 
 perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). 
 Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work 
 under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; 
 provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this 
 License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted 
 under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force 
 and effect unless terminated as stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
 .
    Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the 
 Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and 
 conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
    Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers 
 to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and 
 conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
    If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under 
 applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the 
 remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the 
 parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum 
 extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
    No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach 
 consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by 
 the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
    This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with 
 respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or 
 representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not 
 be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from 
 You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of 
 the Licensor and You.
    The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this 
 License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the 
 Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), 
 the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO 
 Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright 
 Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take 
 effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be 
 enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of 
 those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite 
 of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not 
 granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in 
 the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights 
 under applicable law.
